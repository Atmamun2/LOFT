# Generis Citadel Dynasty (GCD)

A blockchain-based financial ecosystem that records, verifies, and preserves every transaction within family "Houses" across generations, providing complete transparency and financial security for extended family networks.

## Vision

GCD creates a permanent, immutable record of all financial activities within a House - from individual transactions to family business operations - establishing a foundation of trust, transparency, and generational wealth preservation.

## Core Concepts

### Houses
- **Definition**: A collective of individuals, couples, families, extended families, and their business entities
- **Purpose**: Create a unified financial ecosystem where every transaction is recorded and verified
- **Lifespan**: Can span multiple generations as long as one House member remains active in UTB

### Blockchain Integration
- Every transaction is recorded on-chain for permanent verification
- Double-entry accounting system ensures accuracy
- Real-time asset valuation and net worth calculation
- Complete transaction history available for all House members

### Net Time Value
- Calculates the intrinsic value of assets in terms of days of financial independence
- Shows how long an individual can live off their net intrinsic value
- Provides clear path to financial security and retirement

## Key Features
